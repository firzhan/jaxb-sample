Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) is a Java standard that defines how Java objects are converted from and to XML. It uses a standard set of mappings.

JAXB defines an API for reading and writing Java objects to and from XML documents.

As JAXB is defined via a specification, it is possible to use different implementations for this standard. JAXB defines a service provider which allows the selection of the JAXB implementation.

It applies a lot of defaults thus making reading and writing of XML via Java relatively easy.
